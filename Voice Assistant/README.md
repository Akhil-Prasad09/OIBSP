## Installation

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.7+ installed on your system.

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

Open Command Prompt or PowerShell and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd voice_assistant_project
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Install PyAudio (Windows)

If you encounter issues with PyAudio installation, try:

```bash
pip install pipwin
pipwin install pyaudio
```

Alternatively, download the appropriate PyAudio wheel file from:
https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyaudio

### Step 3: Run the Application

```bash
python voice_assistant.py
```

## Usage

1. **Start the Application**: Run the Python script
2. **Click "Start Listening"**: The button will turn red and show "Listening..."
3. **Speak Your Command**: Clearly speak one of the supported commands
4. **View Response**: See the conversation in the main tab and hear the audio response
5. **Check History**: Click the "History" tab to see past conversations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Microphone Not Working**:
   - Check if your microphone is properly connected
   - Ensure microphone permissions are granted to Python
   - Try running the application as administrator

2. **PyAudio Installation Error**:
   - Install Visual Studio Build Tools
   - Use the pipwin method mentioned above
   - Try installing a pre-compiled wheel

3. **Speech Recognition Not Working**:
   - Check your internet connection (Google Speech API requires internet)
   - Speak clearly and closer to the microphone
   - Ensure minimal background noise

4. **Text-to-Speech Not Working**:
   - Check system audio settings
   - Try restarting the application
   - Ensure Windows Speech Platform is installed

## Extending the Application

To add more features:

1. **Add New Commands**: Modify the `get_response()` method in `voice_assistant.py`
2. **Integrate APIs**: Add weather APIs, news APIs, etc.
