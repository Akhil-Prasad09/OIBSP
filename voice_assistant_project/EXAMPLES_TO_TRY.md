## üõ†Ô∏è **Hands-On Extension Examples**

### **Example 1: Add Joke Feature (Beginner)**

**Goal:** Make your assistant tell programming jokes

**Method 1 - Automatic (Easy):**
```bash
python add_joke_feature_demo.py
```
Then test by saying: **"Tell me a joke"**

**Method 2 - Manual (Learning):**

1. **Add the joke function** to `voice_assistant.py` after the imports:

```python path=null start=null
import random  # Add this if not present

def get_joke():
    """Return a random programming joke"""
    jokes = [
        "Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs!",
        "How many programmers does it take to change a light bulb? None, that's a hardware problem!",
        "Why did the programmer quit his job? He didn't get arrays!",
        "What's the object-oriented way to become wealthy? Inheritance!",
        "Why do Java developers wear glasses? Because they can't C#!"
    ]
    return random.choice(jokes)
```

2. **Add the voice command** in the `get_response()` method (around line 240):

```python path=null start=null
        # Jokes
        elif "joke" in command or "tell me a joke" in command:
            return get_joke()
```

3. **Test it:** Say **"Tell me a joke"** or **"I want a joke"**

        # Clean the expression for voice commands
        expression = expression.replace("plus", "+").replace("minus", "-")
        expression = expression.replace("times", "*").replace("divided by", "/")
        expression = expression.replace("calculate", "").strip()
        
        # Only allow safe characters
        allowed = set('0123456789+-*/.() ')
        if all(c in allowed for c in expression):
            result = eval(expression)
            return f"The answer is: {result}"
        else:
            return "Sorry, I can only do basic math operations."
    except:
        return "Sorry, I couldn't calculate that. Try something like '5 plus 3'."
```

2. **Add the voice command:**

```python path=null start=null
        # Calculator
        elif "calculate" in command or "plus" in command or "minus" in command:
            return calculate(command)
```

3. **Test commands:**
   - **"Calculate 5 plus 3"**

### **Example 3: Open Applications (Intermediate)**

**Goal:** Let your assistant open Windows applications

**Steps:**

1. **Add this function:**

```python path=null start=null
import subprocess  # Add to imports if not present

def open_app(app_name):
    """Open Windows applications"""
    apps = {
        'notepad': 'notepad.exe',
        'calculator': 'calc.exe',
        'paint': 'mspaint.exe',
        'file explorer': 'explorer.exe',
        'browser': 'start chrome'
    }
    
    app_name = app_name.lower().strip()
    if app_name in apps:
        try:
            subprocess.Popen(apps[app_name], shell=True)
            return f"Opening {app_name.title()}..."
        except Exception as e:
            return f"Could not open {app_name}"
    else:
        return f"I don't know how to open {app_name}. Try: notepad, calculator, paint, file explorer, or browser"
```

2. **Add the voice command:**

```python path=null start=null
        # Open applications
        elif "open" in command:
            app_name = command.replace("open", "").strip()
            return open_app(app_name)
```

3. **Test commands:**
   - **"Open notepad"**
   - **"Open calculator"**
   - **"Open browser"**

### **Exercise 2: Voice Recognition Improvements**

**Challenge:** Improve voice recognition by:
1. Adding more ways to say the same command
2. Handling different accents/pronunciations
3. Adding error recovery for misheard commands

**Example:**
```python path=null start=null
# Instead of just checking for "time"
elif "time" in command:
    # Check for multiple variations
elif any(phrase in command for phrase in ["time", "what time", "current time", "clock"]):
```

### **Exercise 3: GUI Enhancements**

**Ideas to try:**
1. Add a settings tab for voice speed, volume
2. Add buttons for common commands
3. Change colors/themes
4. Add status indicators for mic/speaker

```bash
pip install xyz
```

### **Problem: Voice recognition not working**

4. Speak clearly and close to mic

### **Problem: Text-to-speech not working**
**Solutions:**
1. Check system volume
2. Try different TTS voices
3. Restart the application

### **Problem: Application crashes**
**Solutions:**
1. Check the console for error messages
2. Restore from backup: `voice_assistant_backup.py`
3. Run the test script: `python test_functionality.py`
